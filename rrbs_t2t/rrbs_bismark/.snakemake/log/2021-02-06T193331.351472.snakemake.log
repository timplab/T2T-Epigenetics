MissingOutputException in line 58 of /home/phook2/code/rrbs/rrbs_data_parse.smk:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
/kyber/Data/NGS/projects/rrbs_chm13/bsseq/SRR951000_bismark_bt2_pe.bam
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
